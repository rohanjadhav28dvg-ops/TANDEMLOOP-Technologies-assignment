## 📱 Responsiveness

For each section (Section 1, Section 2, Section 3), I’ve created both desktop and mobile versions ensuring visual consistency and responsive layout adjustments. The mobile designs were optimized for smaller screens (approx. 375px width).

## 📝 Notes

- I carefully analyzed and recreated the provided designs pixel-perfectly while maintaining the hierarchy and alignment.
- Mobile versions adapt stacking, spacing, and font sizing based on responsive best practices.
- All design assets are organized in Figma and exported as high-resolution PNGs.
- If icons/images were missing from the provided resources, suitable placeholders or similar open-source assets were used.
